# Design for Emerging Technologies (DET), Stockholm University - Lab Session 4: Unity-Esp32 Communication
This repository was created as an initial template for students to use when developing basic applications with IoT devices, such as the ESP32, Meta Quest HMDs, and the Unity Game Engine. Its contents serve as a tutorial for future tasks in the Design for Emerging Technologies (DET) course at Stockholm University.

 ## Dependencies
 
  This project makes use of the following hardware:
   - Esp32 Dev Board (we will be using either an [Esp32 WROOM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663) or [Esp32-S2 WROOM](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17743) from SparkFun Electronics)
   - Any [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/se/en/quest/) series headset (with the exception of Quest 1). There is also an example that does not require a headset

This project makes use of the following software:
 - [Unity](https://unity.com/download) v2022.3.53f1 or above
 - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) v2.3.4 or above

This project makes use of the following plugins or libraries:
- [Meta XR Core SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-core-sdk-269169) v72 (Unity)
- [Meta XR Interaction SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/meta-xr-interaction-sdk-265014) v72 (Unity)
